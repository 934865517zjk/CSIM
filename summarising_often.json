It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.\nChatGPT: Why is it called Dear White People?\nHuman: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.\nChatGPT: Yeah, but why is it so good?\nHuman: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.\nChatGPT: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?\nHuman: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.\nChatGPT: How's that?\nHuman: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.\nChatGPT: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?\nHuman: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist.
